# GitHub write access
# Note: GitHub domains are already in base allowlist for read access.
# This preset is a marker for documentation - the actual git push
# control is via the .git mount being read-only.
#
# To enable git push temporarily:
#   1. The .git directory is mounted read-only by default
#   2. Use separate worktrees for write access
#   3. Or manually remount with write access if needed
#
# GitHub API domains (already in base, listed for reference):
# github.com
# api.github.com
# codeload.github.com
